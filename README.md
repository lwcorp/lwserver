Small, quick and efficient, if you want to test mail clients, this emulator lets you trick them into thinking your computer.

## Installation
1. Run the program.
1. Set your local mail clients to use SMTP server 127.0.0.1 (aka localhost), which refers to your own computer.
    * Optionally set it to use port 25, but it should already be the default.

## Usage
1. Send a message from local mail clients (like https://github.com/lwcorp/lwblat).
1. The program will show the message and make the mailer think the message was actually sent.

### System Requirements
